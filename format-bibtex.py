"""
Format a bibtex file.

1. Organize alphabetically by ID.
2. Only include the following fields: author, year, title, journal,
   volume, number, pages, doi.

Usage:
  python format-bibtex.py file.bib

Note that it overwrites the original bibtex file, but only if the
script completes successfully. If the script fails due to an error,
the original file is unmodified and a temporary file of the same name
is available in /tmp. The last entry in this temporary file is the
last bibtex entry that was successfully formated.
